          You manifest a minor wonder, a sign of supernatural power, within
          range. You create one of the following magical effects within range:
          Your voice booms up to three times as loud as normal for 1 minute. You
          cause flames to flicker, brighten, dim, or change color for 1 minute.
          You cause harmless tremors in the ground for 1 minute. You create an
          instantaneous sound that originates from a point of your choice within
          range, such as a rumble of thunder, the cry of a raven, or ominous
          whispers. You instantaneously cause an unlocked door or window to fly
          open or slam shut. You alter the appearance of your eyes for 1 minute.
          If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its
          1-minute effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect
          as an action.

          Lightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to a creature you
          try to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. You have
          advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of
          metal. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 lightning damage, and it canâ€™t
          take reactions until the start of its next turn.

          As an action, you may draw from the top of the deck and reveal a card.
          Use the Wild Oracle card list to determine the effect that activates
          from the card. The Wild Oracle table shows how many draw actions you
          can perform. You regain all of your draw actions when you finish a
          short or long rest.

          When you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon
          that you're holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack
          with a different light melee weapon that you're holding in the other
          hand. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus
          attack, unless that modifier is negative. If either weapon has the
          thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee
          attack with it.

          Starting at 6th level, you gain the power to reverse the tide of bad
          fortune. As a reaction, you may discard the top card from your deck,
          and reroll any attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you have
          just made. This feature may only be used once per roll, and you must
          take the results of your second roll. You may choose to use this
          feature after determining whether or not the roll was successful.
